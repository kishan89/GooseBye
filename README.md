# GooseBye
Senior Design BU - Team 15

This app controls our GooseBye system, intended to remove geese from soccer fields.

Utilizing image recognition, a mounted camera identifies geese, a raspberry pi sends this to the app, and the app then commands a DJI Phantom Drone to each goose location until they are removed from the soccer field.
